# assets-info

This repo is convenient for assets owner to update some off-chain information such as website, twitter, etc. of asset displayed in [Subscan](https://darwinia.subscan.io/assets).

## How to update

1. Fork this repository
2. If there is no asset you want to update in the description file in the `./assets` directory, then create a new file first like `./assets/<any name>.json`, and the file format refers to [template.json](./assets/template.json) and [Description file](#description-file). Then update the information you need to update in the description file
3. If you need to update the logo, put your logo to `./logos/<network_category_symbol>.<svg/png>`
4. Finally, make a pull request to our repo, and replace placeholders of `Asset Owner & Signature Account`, `Signature Hash` or `Your Identity`
5. Done, now you can create and wait for the PR Checker to pass your request, and our team will double-check and confirm your request
6. After pr is merged, we will release new version (usually in one or two days), and asset info will be updated on Subscan.

> Some naming conventions about logo file
> - File Extension: `png`/`svg` (Uppercase PNG/SVG is considered invalid)
> - File Name: `network_category_symbol.<png/svg>` (e.g.rockmine_asset_ABC.png)
> - Size: Less than `30KB`
> - Background: Preferably transparent

## About the signature

In [Subscan](https://darwinia.subscan.io/assets), assets are currently divided into five categories: `asset`, `system`, `custom`, `erc20`, and `erc721`. If the asset category you update is `asset`, you need to sign your updated description file:

1. Copy the entire description file content
2. You can use [polkadot apps signing](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/signing) to sign. In the [polkadot apps signing](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/signing), use the owner or admin account of the asset to sign the file content
3. Then you can get the signed information.

## Asset categories

`asset`, `system`, `custom`, `erc20`, `erc721`

## Why the Signature Checker report **Not-Verified**

1. Make sure you haven't changed other formats except for angle brackets(\<\>) and included words
2. Make sure the signature you put is made by the same Asset Owner/Admin
3. Make sure your description file is in valid JSON format
4. Probably our Signature checker give up its job :(
